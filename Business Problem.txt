Veganism has been around since 1944, when it was introduced to the world as the encouragement to use of alternatives to animal products. But Veganism wasn’t that popular back then.
It was only in the XXI century and with the help of the Internet that considerable amounts of people started becoming adepts of this lifestyle.

Identifying the Business Problem:

A group of Canadian investors decided to make a move and take advantage of this scenario of the Veganism growth around the world to start a vegan restaurant in a promising city. 
After considering the possible cities, the investors decided that they would start the restaurant in one of the two following cities: Toronto or Vancouver.

The main question is “Which city is more promising for the vegan restaurant?” To answer it, there are some interesting questions we could ask in order to strengthen and 
consolidate our final answer, such as “Which city has more competition?”, “Where are the competition located in the city?” and “Is veganism more popular in Toronto or in 
Vancouver?”.
